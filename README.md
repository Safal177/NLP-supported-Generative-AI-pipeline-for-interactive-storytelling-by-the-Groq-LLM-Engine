# Project Title:	
Natural Language Processing (NLP) supported Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) pipeline for interactive storytelling by the Groq Large Language Models (LLMs) Engine

# Project Background:
Groq LLM engine (Large Language Models (LLMs) is used for creating interactive storytelling where storylines are created according to user input (text). This project shows step by step how generative AI
including natural language generation methods can handle various situations to make conversing domains such as story development, interactive story paths, and choice oriented adventurers. 
Best part is without using traditional rule based storytelling environments, this project uses generative AI to make customizable and convincing storylines. With a good combination between the user and the AI model, unique storylines can be easily created. 

# Core Technologies:
•	Coding language: Python,
•	Workspace: Jupyter Notebook,
•	Model interface: Groq LLM engine (instead of ChatGPT),
•	Libraries applied: dataclasses, typing, uuid, dotenv, Groq api integrating with LLM,
•	Architecture emphasis: NLP, LLM implementation, user/computer integration.

# Project Objective:
The key to this project is to make an AI based interactive storytelling pipeline which is used to create storylines between user and AI collaboration. Some objectives are:
•	Making a platform in Python which is flexible for creating story. 
•	Using Grow’s LLM interface to generate story elements. 
•	Multiple trajectories connected properly to get expected results from user text sequences.
•	Clearly shown imaginative skills of generative AI with NLP based applications.  

# Core Highlights:  
•	Adjustable story topics,
•	Character design,
•	Background creation,
•	Two-way talk between user and AI model,
•	Multiple routes used for getting goal-oriented results,
•	Configurable module used for story rhythm

# Project Conclusion:
In this project, I clearly created an interactive storytelling adventure using Generative AI. I also design a system for taking user inputs and then giving appropriate outputs using Groq LLM. This system is usable in various fields such as storytelling tools under AI-supported, real time class dialogue design, engaging discussion systems, and so on. The project clearly demonstrates my key skills in Python built on workflow design | LLM incorporation | NLP | prompt engineering | AI-based text production.
